# Preamble
As with all journeys, this journey began in 2011 at the peak of IAC movement, It marked my transformation from an Individual to a citizen. Over the next 4 years I with thousands of other Indians entered politics for the first time. 

I am not sure whether I succeeded in our mission to transform Indian politics. I do not know whether I have transformed or help transform another Individual. This then is a by product of my self discovery, my self transformation. My search for myself in my community, and my role in my government.

Career politicians and political scientist's may differ with the views in this text. Maybe I am not seeing the elephant, Maybe I am only describing its tail! So be it. This then is a layman's guide to politics!

# Genesis
Any story being's at the beginning, and some do not have an ending... To search for the beginning of our story we need to pierce the fog of time and history, going beyond history to the time the first man walked on earth. He invariably came from a long line of freak ape's each generation mutated in a a small manner compared to the previous, until the rest of the ape community decided that our man was a man and not an ape.
