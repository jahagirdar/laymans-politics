# Preamble
As with all journeys, this journey began in 2011 at the peak of IAC movement, It marked my transformation from an Individual to a citizen. Over the next 4 years I with thousands of other Indians entered politics for the first time. 

I am not sure whether I succeeded in our mission to transform Indian politics. I do not know whether I have transformed or help transform another Individual. This then is a by product of my self discovery, my self transformation. My search for myself in my community, and my role in my government.

Career politicians and political scientist's may differ with the views in this text. Maybe I am not seeing the elephant, Maybe I am only describing its tail! So be it. This then is a layman's guide to politics!
